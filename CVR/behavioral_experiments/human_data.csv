This is the best I can do: each square had 2 groups of shapes in it. The shapes in a group were either the same color, or two different colors. The rule was, if both shapes in one group in a square were the same color, and both shapes in the other group in a square were two different colors, then all the other squares needed to have that same pattern (the shapes in one group the same color, and the shapes in the other group 2 different colors). The colors did not matter though, the first square could have 2 blue shapes, 1 green shape, and one red shape, and the next square have 2 yellow shapes, one blue shape, and one red shape, and that would be fine.
